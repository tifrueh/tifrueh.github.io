Hi there, I'm Timo. Nice to see you out here in the depths of the web.

I am a computer science student and a generally techy person, and I have lately
begun delving a bit more into the whole indie web thing. After some months of
participating rather silently, various other people's posts (most of which
you'll find on the [/links](/links) page) inspired me to start my
own thing. And here I sit, typing out the About page of my very own personal
website. It feels positively peculiar and wonderfully exciting.

## Me

Computers are a big part of my life. I study computer science, occasionally work
in IT, and I love to play video games with my buddies or on my own. I also
very much enjoy working on my side projects whenever I find the time.

Nevertheless, I also have some analogue hobbies, which I cherish just as much
as my digital ones (maybe even a bit more). I love playing the piano and
listening to rock music. I'm an avid reader of Fantasy and Horror, although I
don't find as much time for reading as I'd like. I also love to go for the
occasional walk across the rolling countryside surrounding the small village I
call home. There are some truly fantastic views to enjoy around here. But in
the end, there is nothing that brings me quite as much pleasure as good
conversation with good friends around a bonfire on a starry night.

## This Site

I'm using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) to build this site. All code is hosted [on
GitHub](https://github.com/tifrueh/tifrueh.github.io) and you can always take a
look at it, if you like.

There is no HUGO theme in use, but rather custom layout files and custom CSS.
The whole design is heavily inspired by [Cory's](https://coryd.dev),
[Kev's](https://kevquirk.com) and [Robb's](https://rknight.me) sites.

The site aims for a kind of terminal-esque look, all text uses [Source Code
Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro), and all colours stem
from the [onehalfdark](https://github.com/sonph/onehalf/tree/master) colour
scheme. And in case you're asking yourself whether those colours and this font are
the ones I always use when configuring *anything*, you would be
correct indeed, my friend.

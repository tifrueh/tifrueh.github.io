While rummaging around in my memories of the "good ol' times"[^1], I remembered
a speech I held some time ago. We had been tasked by our English teacher to
write and perform a speech about *literally anything* and I'd just begun
reading "The Tao Of Seneca" by Tim Ferriss[^2] a short while before that. So I
wrote a speech about Seneca.

[^1]: I find myself doing that waaay too often lately.

[^2]: If you're interested in philosophy (or also if you're not, but
    considering learning more about it), I'd definitely recommend you read it.
    It's a collection of Seneca's instructive letters, translated into English.
    You can download PDFs of all three volumes for free on [Tim's
    website](https://tim.blog/2017/07/06/tao-of-seneca/).

After rereading it, I thought it'd be cool to upload it here. To make sure I
don't lose it, for one, but also because this blog is a space for my writing, so
why shouldn't I put some of my old writing on here as well? (And maybe I also
want to remind myself that I didn't always struggle *so much* to assemble these
thoughts and feelings in my head into sentences that feel like more than just a
heap of dead letters to me.)

Imagine a fine spring morning in the year of '22, the kind that makes you feel
like everything is *just* the way it has to be. The kind that makes you take a
deep breath and smile at the rising sun with all the peace and tranquillity
humanly possible. Imagine a classroom full of laughter and good humour, all my
old classmates taking their accustomed place in the classroom. There is one
exception, though. One student, a tall young man, just a few weeks short of
nineteen, makes his way to the lectern, clutching his notes nervously, his
fingers shaking ever so slightly. And then, the bell rings[^3] &#x2026;

[^3]: "The nostalgia is strong in this one", I know.

> In this letter, which is the third of his collection, by the way, if you want to

> “friend”. And Seneca does *not* like this, at all. He tells Lucilius: “If you
> consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as you trust yourself, you are
> mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently understand what true friendship
> means.” And later, he also states: “When friendship is settled, you must trust;
> before friendship is formed, you must pass judgment.” Pretty commanding, right?
> Well, yes, but I personally think that this directness is part of why Seneca has

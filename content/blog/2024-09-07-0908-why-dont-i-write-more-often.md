While writing my last post [On Making Sense]({{% ref
"/blog/2024-08-09-2125-on-making-sense.md" %}}), I asked myself, multiple
times, why it always takes me so long to start writing again after having
published a blogpost. It is a weird thing that has always tended to happen,
ever since I started this blog at the beginning of the year.

It feels strange to me, because I *really* enjoy writing. Ordering my thoughts
and emotions and putting them into words seems to have an almost therapeutic
effect on me. I always feel a lot lighter and more at peace after doing it.

But I think I've now figured out the reason why, or at least part of it: Every
time I finish a post and am happy with it, I seem to lose the confidence that I
could ever again write something like it in terms of quality or ingenuity. Not
that I think that my posts are exceptionally high-quality or particularly
ingenious, it's rather that I think to myself:

"That actually wasn't half-bad … It can only go downhill from here."

And then it takes me weeks, or even months — depending on how quickly I
discover a new topic I'm excited to write about, or revisit my "post ideas"
list — to progress from:

"Hm. Should I write another post? No. I don't think so. I want the next one to
be at least marginally as good as the last one, and I don't think I'm capable
of that right now."

to:

"Damn. I don't know … I might actually be able to write a decent text about
this."

Which is, as a whole, not a particularly positive mindset to have, I imagine.

So yeah, I think I need to remind myself from time to time that if I stop doing
something for fear of failing to become better at it, I will actively manifest
*exactly* this fear. If I do, on the other hand, continue to *do the thing*,
thus accepting that mistakes will happen, *have* to happen, in order for me to
improve and to grow … well … then I will, in all likelihood, one day, be able
*do the thing* in a way that is not only as good as, but possibly even better
than "half-bad".

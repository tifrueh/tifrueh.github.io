If you're a reader of this blog who knows me personally, you might have
wondered why I chose English as the main language for this website. This was
originally a topic I'd wanted to put on the About page, but I kind of forgot to
include it when I was writing the text for said About page. This fact came to my
attention recently, when I was reviewing some of the stuff I've written since
the beginning, so I figured I'd just write a full post about it, in which I'd
also be able to go into the details a bit more, which I thought would be nice.

Now, there are two distinct reasons for my writing this blog in English, I
think. For one, English is almost always the language of choice when talking
about IT online. Take GitHub, for example, or almost all documentation on
popular pieces of software or APIs. So it kind of just felt natural to start
writing in English when I first opened the file that was to contain my first
blog post. And in addition to that, I can now also practice my English, which is
a really great, because it has become quite rusty in the last 1.5 years or so,
during my military service.

The second reason is a less technical one. And it's a bit hard to explain, to be
honest. But I'll try, nonetheless.

I guess that I have some kind of a different connection to English than to
German or to my mother tongue, which is Swiss German. My not wanting to write in
Swiss German I can kind of understand, because, in my opinion, it is just really
not a pretty language and I generally dislike Swiss German writing or poetry.
I'm sure that some people enjoy it, and there are certainly many talented
writers, poets and musicians who practice their respective art in Swiss German,
but it just isn't for me.

It becomes a bit more complicated when I think of German (or *High German*, more
specifically).

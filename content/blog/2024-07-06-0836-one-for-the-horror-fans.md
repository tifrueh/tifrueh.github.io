I haven't written anything in quite a while, despite now having an ever-growing
list of things to write about. It's quite hilarious, to be honest. Back in May,
I was very motivated to sit down and type away, but I didn't have any good idea
what the hell to type about. So I started a list. And now this list has quite a
few entries, and there were indeed some moments in the last two months at which
I thought to myself: "Hm, I really should write something for the blog. And I
do actually have some post ideas on my list, so yeah, why not." But I never got
around to it. Maybe the "really *should*" part was the problem.

But anyway, I'm rambling. To ease myself back into it, I thought I'd start with a
rather easy one and write about a piece of cinematography I enjoyed tremendously.

I watched [Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of
Curiosities](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8415836/) some time ago, and while I
liked almost all of the episodes / short films / whatever you want to call
them, there was one that really stood out to me: [The
Autopsy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14920160/), based on the short story by
[Michael Shae](https://www.michaelsheaauthor.com/stories/).[^1]

[^1]: I haven't read the story myself, as it seems to only be available as part
    of a collection contained in a book, which I'd have to buy first, but I
    might do so in the future.

It is set in the aftermath of a peculiar mining accident. One of the miners
seems to have brought some kind of weird explosive with him one day, detonating
it in one of the tunnels, killing himself and a score of his colleagues.
Following this incident, the local police launches an investigation into the
matter, discovering more and more strange and disturbing details. In an attempt
to shine some light onto this grisly case, a coroner is consulted by the local
sheriff to examine the corpses of the miners. And so, this coroner, an old
friend of the sheriff's, begins his autopsy at sundown, dissecting the bodies
one by one, audiotaping his every move, and, as of yet, utterly ignorant of the
unspeakable horrors the night would come to hold.

This short is one of the very few visual works of horror fiction that really
appeals to my particular taste in the written version of said genre, combining
the suspense and mystery of a criminal investigation with elements of truly
Lovecraftian cosmic horror. Instead of losing itself in gory visual details,
as, in my opinion, many horror movies tend to, it manages to create and
maintain an eerie atmosphere from the beginning to the end, telling a
compelling and wonderfully intricate story about friendship, death and
otherworldly horrors from beyond.

So, yeah, if you are, like me, an enjoyer of weird tales whispered in the
darkness (and if your stomach is strong enough to withstand several autopsies
and some self-mutilation), I'd highly recommend you give this one a watch.

I'm starting my studies at the ETH in Zurich today — in about an hour, in fact,
I'm sitting in the train as I'm typing this — and I couldn't be more excited,
but I also couldn't be more terrified.

Today (finally) marks the definite end of the military intermission to my life,
but it also marks the beginning of a new era with new chances, new pitfalls and
new uncertainties, causing me to ask myself all the same age-old questions.

Will I be good enough?

Am I prepared enough?

Will I find new friends?

Will I be able to maintain old friendships?

Those are all good questions, but none of them are answerable right now. And
that's *good*. I mean, life would be quite dull if we already knew what the
future held, wouldn't it?

So … All I can say to myself is this:

Let's go and see.

To quote an old favourite of mine:

> So let the engines roar  
> Push the pedal down  
> I want the white lines on the highway  
> To lead me out of town  
>
> I'm rolling on and on and on  
> Who knows where I'm goin'  
>
> Life is an open road  
> It's the best story never told

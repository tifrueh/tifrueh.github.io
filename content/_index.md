Hello there, and welcome to my humble website.

I am a computer science student and a generally techy person, and I have
recently begun delving a bit more into the whole indie web / personal website
thing. I was inspired enough by various other people's different posts to want
to start my own thing. You'll find all those incredible posts and people (and
much more) on the [link page](/links-and-blogroll).

Hello there, I'm Timo, welcome to my website.

I am a computer science student and a generally techy person, and I have lately
begun delving a bit more into the whole indie web thing. After some months of
participating rather silently, various other people's posts (most of which
you'll find on the [/links](/links-and-blogroll) page) inspired me to start my
own thing.
